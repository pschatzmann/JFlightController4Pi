/**
 * Sensors which are updating the parameters. Initially I planned to provide some generic functionality. 
 * But I had to realize that the reading and interpreting of the sendor values can be quite tricky. 
 * The BMP180 e.g. is just a nightmare. For the time beeing I prefer to use these cheap components however.
 * In Arduino this complexity is hidden with the help of libraries!
