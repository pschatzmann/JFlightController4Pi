# Teach the Airplane to Lift

There are 2 controls involved in lifting an airplane:

- Raising an airplane needs energy - so we need to open up the throttle to make the motors spin faster so that we can keep a constant speed
- The elevator makes a plane go up or down - so in order to lift the plane it needs to be raised.

We are using a PIDs to control the speed and another to control the elevation (angle).
Since we do this the first time, we do not want to do this exercise with a real plane: We can use our integration into Flightgear instead to validate if we can implement a stable, working system.
We use the Cessna 172P for our simulation. In real life things tend to get quite complicated but we try to simplify with the assumption that a model airplane is good natured and has much bigger savety limits. 


 ## Speed Control Loop
 
 - Control Input: Target Speed (kmh)
 - Measured Input: Speed (kmh)
 - Output: Throttle (0.2 to 1)
 
 In order to be able to fly savely we limit the speed to the range of 100 - 185 kmh.
 We need to make sure that the motor is not dying off if we give not enough throttle.
 

 ## Elevation Control Loop

 - Control Input: Elevation (in degrees)
 - Measured Input: Elevation (in degrees) from Sensors
 - Output: Elevator (-1 to 1)
 
We limit the elevation angle to the range of (-40 - 40 degrees) 
The takeoff will not be automatic. It will be up to the pilot to raise the elevator when the takeoff speed has been reached
