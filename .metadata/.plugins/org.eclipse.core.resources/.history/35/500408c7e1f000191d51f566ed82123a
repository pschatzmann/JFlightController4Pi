# Remote Control
It is my understanding that the PI is struggling with the processing of **RV protocols**: PWM, PPM, SBUS, IBUS.
- **PWM** should be streight forward - except that it uses up quite a few pins. 
- The **other protocols** are either only partly supported or quite impossible to implement w/o additional hardware

This is however not a problem for my purpose because I plan to use the built in **WLAN or Bluetooth** so that I
can control the plane e.g. with the help of a mobile phone. I might consider to add **IBUS** support however to increase
the distance...
