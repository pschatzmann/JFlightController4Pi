# Teach the Controller to fly the Airplane

There are 2 controls involved in lifting an airplane:

- Raising an airplane needs energy - so we need to open up the throttle to make the motors spin faster so that we can keep a constant speed
- The elevator makes a plane go up or down - so in order to lift the plane it needs to be raised.

We are using a PIDs to control the speed and another to control the elevation (angle).
Since we do this the first time, we do not want to do this exercise with a real plane: We can use our integration into Flightgear instead to validate if we can implement a stable, working system.
We use the Cessna 172P for our simulation. In real life things tend to get quite complicated but we try to simplify with the assumption that a model airplane is good natured and has much bigger savety limits. 

The takeoff will not be automatic. It will be up to the pilot to raise the elevator when the takeoff speed has been reached. 
We also do not implement any automatic stall avoidance, detection or recovery. 

The goal is to have a system that is flying stable straight ahead when all input controls are at their
neutral position and that is going up in a constant speed if we lift the elevator.

Multiple PID controllers are used to mange the plane: 

 ## Speed Control Loop
 
 - Control Input: Target Speed (kmh)
 - Measured Input: Speed (kmh)
 - Output: Throttle (0.2 to 1)
 
 In order to be able to fly safely (to avoid stalls or structural damage) we limit the speed to 
 the range of 100 - 185 kmh with a neutral speed of 142.
 We also need to make sure that the motor is not dying off if we give not enough throttle.
 

 ## Elevation Control Loop

 - Control Input: Elevation (in degrees) - [Range -40 - 40 degrees] 
 - Measured Input: Elevation (in degrees) from Sensors
 - Output: Elevator (-1 to 1)
 
To avoid stalls because we climb too steep, we limit the elevation angle.


 ## Turns 
 
In 3 Channel Model Airplanes the turns are usually done with the help of the Rudder.  
In real life this is mainly done with the ailerons and the rudder is used to coordinate the turn or if the plain is still on the ground.
In our simplified implementation we will just use the ailerons:

 - Control Input: Roll (in degrees) - [Range -30 -30 degrees]
 - Measured Input: Roll (in degrees) from Sensors
 - Output: Aileron (-1 to 1)

In order to avoid unstable turns we limit the roll angle.


## Implementation in JFlightController4Pi

The cool thing with our solution is, that we can implement this w/o any programming language and we can just specify
the solution in XML:
